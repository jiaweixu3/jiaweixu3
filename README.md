# üòÅ Welcome to Jiawei's GitHub!

I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Data Science and Engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.  
Here are some of the projects I've worked on!

### ‚öôÔ∏è Projects

#### [üîπ Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic Survival](https://github.com/jiaweixu3/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-TITANIC)
- Conducted full **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on 668 passengers using **R**.  
- **Quantified the impact of key variables** on survival rates and uncovered **non-obvious insights** about social and travel factors.  
- Engineered new features to enhance dataset interpretability.  
- Created **7+ custom visualizations** with **ggplot2** (boxplots, stacked bars, jitter plots) to clearly communicate findings.  
- Authored a detailed analytical report summarizing methods, results, and visuals.

#### [üîπ Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)](https://github.com/jiaweixu3/Machine-Learning-Prediction-TITANIC)
- Developed, tuned, and evaluated **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models to predict passenger survival on the 668-passenger Titanic dataset.  
- Applied **grid search** and **cross-validation** to optimize hyperparameters and improve model reliability.  
- **Quantified the importance of key features**, identifying the primary drivers of survival.  
- Achieved **84% mean accuracy** with the optimized Random Forest model.  
- Produced clean and reusable **R scripts** capable of making predictions on new data.  
- Documented the workflow and insights in a structured report, including visualizations and interpretations of model results.  

#### [üîπ Mario Bros. (1983) ‚Äì Pyxel Clone](https://github.com/jiaweixu3/Mario-Bros-Pyxel-Clone)
- Developed a from-scratch clone of the 1983 arcade classic *Mario Bros.* using **Python** and the **Pyxel** library.
- Engineered a **custom 2D physics engine** to manage player gravity, acceleration, and jump momentum realistically.
- Implemented **advanced enemy AI** with unique behaviors for each enemy type (Turtle, Crab, Fly) using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
- Built a **pixel-perfect collision detection system** for all interactions (player-enemy, player-platform, enemy-platform).
- Managed the complete **game loop and state management**, including enemy spawning, stage progression, a 3-life system, and game over state.
- Structured the project modularly with **OOP design**, making it scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

#### [üîπ Asturias Tourism Dashboard (Excel)](https://github.com/jiaweixu3/Excel-Asturias-Tourism-Analysis)
- Built a **comprehensive interactive Excel dashboard** analyzing tourism trends in Asturias using **50,000+ data points** from multiple datasets (hotels, restaurants, traveler spending, motivations, hotel prices, traveler types, and valuations).  
- Developed **complex Pivot Tables** and **dynamic charts** to summarize data and highlight actionable insights.  
- Implemented **VBA macros and interactive buttons** for smooth dashboard navigation, filtering, and interactivity.  
- Applied **advanced Excel formulas** (`IF()`, `XLOOKUP()`, `VLOOKUP()`, `UPPER()`, `SEARCH()`, `COUNTIF()`, `LARGE()`) for in-depth data analysis.  
- Designed **structured tables, conditional formatting, custom fonts, and cell styling** for a professional, readable dashboard.  
- Embedded **sparklines and mini charts** for quick, at-a-glance trend visualization.  
- Provided a **visual overview of the dashboard** with a screenshot (Excel file itself is fully interactive).
